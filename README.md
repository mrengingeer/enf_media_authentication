Looking for ENF within audio files
Using audio recording from computer and phone for comparisons
All save files are in .wav format which samples at 44.1 KHz
Will look for which where ENF signals are clear
Will find a time frequency resolution for optimal ENF extraction
Will compare two ENF signals to find time lag between them
